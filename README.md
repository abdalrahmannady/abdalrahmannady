# Hi there, I'm Abdelrahman Younis 👋

### 🚀 About Me
"I am a passionate Self-Taught Programmer who began my journey in 2022. I started by exploring Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap 5) to get a feel for the software world and understand how things are built.

Currently, I am diving deep into C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). My focus is on building a rock-solid programming foundation and mastering the core logic of software engineering before specializing in Mobile Development (Flutter). I believe that a strong base is what separates a good developer from a great one."
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **OOP Principles** and **Advanced C++ Concepts**.
- 🎯 Goal: To build efficient and scalable software solutions.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** C++,Js.
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Visual Studio.

### 📁 My First OOP Project But but not my first project at all.
Check out my [OOP Calculator][(https://github.com/abdalrahmannady/OOP-Calculator-CPP.git) My first step into organized, object-oriented code!

📈 Learning Progress
I have successfully completed 9 levels of deep programming foundations and am currently working on Level 10 (OOP).
